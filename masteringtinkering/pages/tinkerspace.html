              <h3>Tinkering spaces</h3>

              <p>Tinkering is not something I often do physically. As mainly a programmer, most of what I would consider a tinkering project 
                have been digital. I did however throughout the years do some physical tinkering as well, and these are the spaces I consider real tinkering spaces.
              </p>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/room-enske.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>My current desk in Enschede where I do most of my tinkering.</p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/livingroom-table.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>If I run out of room, for example when making "Surprises", I move to the living room table.
                I consider this the place with the most potential. While mostly empty, it's a good space to both work at and get feedback from housemates while I am at it.
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/design-lab.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>The design lab was a fun tinkering space during my pre-masters. I had a similar space during my baechelors, 
                but I did not take pictures of this one. I spent many hours working on arduino elements here for the Create module 8 project or other
                prototyping tasks.
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/electronics-drawer.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>My electronic junk drawer with laptops, arduinos, random electronic parts and tools. I often like to just clean it up to see what
                kind of toys I can use when I have leftover time.
              </p>
              
              
              <h3>My thinking space</h3>

              <p>Besides just tinkering, thinking or thinkering is also a very important part in my opinion. These are the places where ideas are formed or grow.
                I have a very vivid imagination and often already start prototyping in my head before I even start putting things down on paper or start building.
              </p>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/shower.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>The classic shower thought is not just for show. For some reason this place yields amazing results when in need of good ideas, or "seeds" for projects.
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/bed.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>Another great spot for thinking is my bed. I like working in the evenings, and when things mentally block I find going to bed to be one of the best and worst ideas.
                While great for getting new ideas, this often comes at the cost of getting less sleep.
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/chair.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>Finally just my usual chair in which I always sit. Just taking a step back, be it in a chair or going for a walk, really help with getting
                the old thinking machine back in shape. Walks are probably my favourite way of ideating, either alone or with a group of people.
              </p><br>

              <h3>Tinkering background</h3>

              <p>While tinkering is not neccesairly within my nature, I did grow up fascinated by electricity and making things. I loved legos and lego technic
                and you could often find me working on the little electric science kits such as the one in the photo.
              </p>

              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/electra-toys.jpg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>These are the toys I ab-so-lutely adored as a child. There were many different pieces you could buy and I wanted all of them.
                I have fond memories of playing with these as a kid, and they are basically instructed tinkering kits.
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/lego.jpg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>And of course the legos with all the machines. While I did not have many of my own as a kid my best friend who had limited screen time and I would
                often play with these to make small cars, trains or other moving toys. I remember this cool cablecar I once made and man did I love cablecars
                ever since. At high school these were also readily available with a bunch of different sensors or actuators which was great. 
                Proposed to do my "PWS" with them but sadly was not allowed.
              </p><br>

              <h3>Projects & Tinkers</h3>

              <p>These are some of the tinkering projects I remember best. While not much, it defines my experiences as a tinkerer so far.</p>

              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/mario-kart-arduino.JPG" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>This was probably my first arduino project. I had to learn arduino myself in a very short timespan (2 weeks) so I really got a good
                rushed prototype (which in my opinion yields the best results). I prototyped using Tinkercad and then built this in real life with the limited tools I had
                (a random starter kit from amazon with some random bin from my grandma). I am proud of the result, and the teacher was happy too (Debbie Voerman)
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/jackpot-jinx.png" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>This was the project made for Hybrid Worlds mentioned in <a href="lecture1.html">Lab 1</a>. It was a busy project but fun to ideate, design and program for.</p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/HR-monitor-graduation.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg"><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/hr-monitor-graduation-inside.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>For my graduation I had to prototype a GSR sensor and a heart rate monitor to measure stress. After prototyping both I ended
              up with this beauty of a box, really being a tinker piece in my opinion. It worked well and for a simply thrown together piece 
            it was more then I imagined.</p><br>


              <h3>My virtual tinkering space</h3>

              <p>See now this is my real space where I can use my "toolbox". I love prototyping and making little code snippets or simple interactions using Unity
                or other gameplay programming engines (e.g. processing). This is where I feel most at home tinkering.
              </p>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/unity.png" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>Unity is my real "home". During my beachelors Creative Media and Game Technologies I really used this engine a lot, 
                and I often find myself using it for the most simplest of project requests. While digital, this feels like tinkering
                the most to me as it really allows me to use my creativity to the max, realizing most things that come to mind without
                much effort.
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/tinkercad-circuit.png" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>When it comes to Arduino Tinkercad was my go-to program. While I like testing out projects in real life,
                having a place to simulate everything in a safe environment helped a lot for getting some confidence with using 
                arduino. Great tool!
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/paint.png" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>When it comes to ideating, the step before tinkering, paint is my best friend. Of course Photoshop is nice, but 
                those simple quick ideas are always first visualized in paint. 
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/Empty_Photoshop.png" class="thumbnailimg"><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/ipad.jpeg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>After paint we of course move to photoshop or Goodnote on my ipad to do a proper scetch or wireframe.
                These tools I have often used and I feel really comfortable with. </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/tinkercad-3d.png" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>3D is not my greatest skill, I wish to know it more. I have some limited experience with the modeler in Tinkercad and can use it
                to create simple representations of ideas I have for classes. 
              </p><br>
              <img src="../../masteringtinkering/assets/tinkerspace/magicavoxel.jpg" class="thumbnailimg">
              <p>MagicaVoxel is a simple tool in which I can use "voxels", 3D pixels, to create different models. While it may seem out of place,
                this tool really is useful for making simple models when you cannot model. Its simplicity makes it easy to use and makes it easier to focus on creative freedom.
              </p><br>
              <h3>Verdict</h3>
              <p>
              That was my experience with Tinkering Spaces in a nutshell. While I do tinker from time to time, it's mainly digitally using Unity
              or other programs. I do like making things with my hands though, especially when it comes to things such as Surprises which I mentioned
              before. Creativity is something I often try to fuel with different aspects such as browsing art on social media or watching videos with
              cool projects to motivate me for new things to do.
              </p>
